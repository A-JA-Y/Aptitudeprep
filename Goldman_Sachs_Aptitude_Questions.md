### Reading Comprehension

151-155. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow:

The global financial system has undergone significant transformation over the past decade, largely driven by technological innovation and changing regulatory landscapes. Fintech companies have emerged as key players, challenging traditional banking models and offering innovative solutions to consumers. Goldman Sachs, recognizing this shift, has significantly invested in its digital banking platform, Marcus, to compete in the retail banking space.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated these trends, pushing financial institutions to enhance their digital capabilities as consumer behavior shifted dramatically toward online services. Mobile banking applications, contactless payments, and digital wealth management platforms saw unprecedented growth. Traditional banks had to rapidly adapt to this new reality or risk losing market share to more agile competitors.

Regulatory bodies worldwide have also responded to these changes, implementing new frameworks to address the unique challenges posed by digital finance. Issues such as data privacy, cybersecurity, and financial inclusion have become central to policy discussions. The balance between innovation and risk management remains a key consideration for regulators as they shape the future of finance.

As we look ahead, emerging technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing are poised to further disrupt the financial landscape. Institutions that can effectively leverage these technologies while managing associated risks will likely emerge as leaders in the next era of global finance.

Investment banking has evolved significantly since its origins in the 19th century. Initially focused on raising capital for businesses and governments, modern investment banks now offer a diverse range of services including mergers and acquisitions advisory, securities underwriting, asset management, and trading.

The industry has faced numerous challenges and transformations throughout its history. The 2008 financial crisis led to substantial regulatory changes, including the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States, which aimed to reduce systemic risk and improve transparency. This regulatory shift has fundamentally altered how investment banks operate and manage risk.

Technology has also revolutionized the sector. Algorithmic trading, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence have changed how financial institutions analyze markets and make investment decisions. Additionally, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies present both opportunities and challenges for traditional banking models.

Despite these changes, the core function of investment banking remains connecting those who need capital with those who can provide it. What has evolved is the sophistication of the methods used to achieve this goal and the breadth of services offered to clients.
